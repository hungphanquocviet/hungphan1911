My name is Hung, and I am a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of Utah. Through my coursework, past work experience and personal projects, I have hands-on experience in Back-End Development and data related stuff (data engineering, visualization, AI/ML). 

My interest lies in Computer Graphics, Computer Systems, and Algorithms. I work in C/C++ extensively recently. In my free time, I enjoy solving data structure and algorithm problems (my most active profiles are linked above if you are interested :D) or performing music.

My resume: 

Some code I worked/am working on can be found at my GitHub.
